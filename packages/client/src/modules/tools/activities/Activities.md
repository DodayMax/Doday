# Activities `:Tool` module

`Activities` module provides functionality for organizing all types of `dodays` in one place in the form of the `TODO` app.

`Activities` also provides two new `Entities` - `Activity` and `Goal`.

`Activity` - is a simple todo item, allowing you to plan and track your activities in real life. `Activity` can also use `Extensions` to get additional functionality, for example, you can buy `Resource` extension to be able to attach `Resource` from the Internet to the `Activity`, like `Youtube` video or just a link to some article.

`Goal` - is like a folder for any types of activities. Top level goals become a key categories of the life circle for your `Hero`.

You can create endless nesting `goals` and organize your activities as you wish.
